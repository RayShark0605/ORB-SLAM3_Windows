# ORB-SLAM3_Windows
Executable programs for ORB-SLAM3 on Windows

# Instruction
Download all 3 rar archives (they are compressed in volumes) and then unzip them and run the exe program in the cmd terminal!
My compile environment: Visual Studio 2017, Windows 10. but you shouldn't need to configure any environment on Windows, just make sure those three dll link libraries in the rar are in the same directory as the exe!

The ORB-SLAM3 code used is the version of February 10.(https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3/commit/4452a3c4ab75b1cde34e5505a36ec3f9edcdc4c4)
